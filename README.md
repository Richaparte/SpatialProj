# Moving Objects Trajectory Visualization

This project is a full stack application that performs and visualizes advanced spatial queries including
spatial range, spatio-temporal range and k-nearest neighbors on a moving object trajectory dataset.

The DataFrame consists of trajectory_id, vehicle_id, point geometry and timestamp columns. For this project, we ran three spatial queries on the dataset: spatial range query, spatio-temporal range query, and KNN query.
